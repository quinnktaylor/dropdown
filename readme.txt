Please find the coding assignment attached. 

Technologies Used: 
 - HTML
 - SCSS w a prefixer
 - Vanilla Javascript
 - SVG's for images 

 Design Decisions: 

 Added opacity animations on actionable items that can be seen on both active states 
 and removal of active states for a smoother user experience. The dropdown is also responsive and 
 utilizes fluid widths to ensure the designer's desired aesthetic is kept for as many screen sizes as possible.

 Notes for designers: 
 Try to avoid using custom dropdowns as they can be accessibility nightmares as Devs/Engineers will typically
 have to stray away from the support that comes with select and option tags in order to match the design specs.
